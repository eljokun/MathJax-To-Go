# MathJax-To-Go
Mathjax To Go is a python-contained MathJax TeX expression parser with added functionality and extended options, for those of us that really like time and efficiency.

# Dependencies
The only dependency is PySide6, and whatever dependencies it may have.

# Installation
To install, simply acquire the main script `Mathjax-To-Go.py` and run, either by cloning into this repo or just downloading the code, either works fine.
Click, run and enjoy.
If you do not have PySide6, install it via pip `pip install PySide6` and run again.

# As-is
This project was created mostly for my own personal use as an engineer looking to save time and not succumb to the eldritch horrors of electronics & communications engineering studies.
As such, no support whatsoever for this project is guaranteed nor long term support, though i'll do my best. Any PR-s, ideas, suggestions an issues i will happily look at though, but i cannot make any guarantees.
